## Problem 3 (Implementing Policy Iteration and Value Iteration) 

In this problem, we will implement policy iteration and value iteration for a classic MDP environment called “Taxi” (Dietterich, 2000). 

This environment has been included in the OpenAI Gym: https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/toy_text/taxi/.
